                <p> <b>
                Over the last few years, Technology has become more and more part of our lives. Take
                a moment to look around you. What do you notice? How many gadgets, computers and tech do you see? Did you
                include the one you're reading this on?
                See how we are surrounded by technical appliances. The laptop on your lap, the mobile phone next to your bed,
                the T.V screen infront of you, the WiFi router, even the headphone- all these are examples of how technology
                has transformed every part of our lives. <br>
                According to my view, technology is inevitable in our day-to-day lives. In today's 
                dynamic world, life without technology is pointless. As being student of IT, I know the importance of
                technology in my daily life. From waking up in the morning to going back to bed in night, Everytime I am 
                surrounded by technical equipments.
                 The purpose of technology is to make life easier and solves many problems of mankind but has its 
                effects all been positive? In this blog, we will precisely see that.

                            devices in our bedroom. This causes intrusion with sleep in a various ways. As per 
                            the recent research and study, it has found that excessive use of technical 
                            equipments before going to bed impacts the sleep on physiological and psychological levels.
                            Over exposure of "blue light" coming out of the screen decreases production of
                            melatonin in body which makes it difficult for people to fall asleep. Lack of sleep 
                            makes people lethargic and less alert.

                negative effects, it also provide a wide range of positive impacts on our daily life. Technology is both
                boon and bane to our life. Every aspects have positive and negative effects. The majority of the adverse
                effects of technology emerges from its missues. The way we handle the utilization of tech can help
                or harm ourselves. Instead of blaming or cursing the technology, we need to use that in a more disciplined
                and healthy way. Knowing about the consequences help in taking steps to recognize and reduce them so that
                we can make the most out of its positive impacts.
